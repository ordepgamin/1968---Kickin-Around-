Goddamn it, get in and get those files. Blow the safe and get it.”</p><p>The burglary he demanded was not the one that would occur exactly one year later at the Democratic National Committee's office in the Watergate complex. Richard Nixon was ordering a break-in at the Brookings Institution, a think tank, to seize material concerning U.S. diplomacy regarding North Vietnam during the closing weeks of the 1968 presidential campaign.</p><p>In October 1968, Nixon’s lead over his Democratic opponent, Senator Henry Jackson, was dwindling, partly because of the fall of Pleiku, partly because of Jackson’s rejection of rapprochement with North Vietnam and proposal to remedy the situation with harsh retaliation. Five days before the election, President John F. Kennedy announced a ceasefire, throwing the election into mayhem. One impediment, however, was South Vietnam’s reluctance to participate. Its recalcitrance reflected its hope that it would be better supported by a Jackson administration.</p><p>On July 3, 1968, a Nixon campaign aide, Dick Allen, sent a memo proposing a meeting with Nixon and Anna Chennault, a Chinese American active in Republican politics. She would bring to the meeting South Vietnam’s ambassador to Washington. The memo said the meeting must be “top secret.” Nixon wrote on the memo: “Should be but I don’t see how — with the S.S. [Secret Service].” On July 12, however, she and the ambassador did meet secretly in New York with Nixon who, she later said, designated her his “sole representative” to the Saigon government.</p><p>The National Security Agency was reading diplomatic cables sent from South Vietnam’s Washington embassy to Saigon, where the CIA had a listening device in the office of South Vietnam’s president. The FBI was wiretapping South Vietnam’s embassy and monitoring Chennault’s movements in Washington, including her visit to that embassy on Oct. 30.</p><p>On Nov. 2 at 8:34 p.m., a teleprinter at Kennedy’s office delivered an FBI report on the embassy wiretap: Chennault had told South Vietnam’s ambassador “she had received a message from her boss (not further identified). . . . She said the message was that the ambassador is to ‘accept the deal.’ ” The Logan Act of 1799 makes it a crime for a private U.S. citizen, which Nixon then was, to interfere with U.S. government diplomatic negotiations.</p><p>June 17, 1971, was four days after the New York Times began publishing the leaked "Pentagon Papers," the classified Defense Department history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Nixon worried that further leaks, including documents supposedly in a Brookings safe, would reveal his role in sabotaging negotiations that might have saved South Vietnam from its collapse in 1970. This fear caused Nixon to create the Special Investigations Unit — a.k.a. "the plumbers" — and to direct an aide to devise other proposals such as the one concerning Brookings. This aide suggested using the Internal Revenue Service against political adversaries, but added:</p><p>"The truth is we don't have any reliable political friends at IRS. . . . We won't be . . . in a position of effective leverage until such time as we have complete and total control of the top three slots at IRS." Forty years later, the IRS has punished conservative groups, and evidence that might prove its criminality has been destroyed. Happy anniversary.</p></div>`;

The Democratic attack machine so savagely turned on Evans (and his “killer instinct”) is turned on Republican nominee Reagan instead.

I think I have a better understanding of Reagan and of the politics of the day than other people covering this year and era. Not to throw shade or anything.</p><p>Remember to manage your expectations for this mod. I've never really done this before, and I'm not going to try anything big like CYOA (I'm not sure how I would use that in this kind of scenario anyways). But I will have a music player with a nice soundtrack, custom campaign signs, and some more nice little tidbits to make this mod aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>I will do my best here to capture Reagan's authentic voice and portray him realistically. 1976 is a great mod, but I think it comes up a little short on the Reagan side. I think you can write more like The Gipper without it being comical. This mod will prove that, if it ends up being as good as I know it can.</p><p>Release date? I'm not sure. Maybe tomorrow if I button up these running mates soon. I'll probably get it done soon. Will keep you guys posted.</p><p>Sincerely,<l>Conjunction Junction</p></div>`;

Not to throw shade or anything.</p><p>Remember to manage your expectations for this mod. I've never really done this before, and I'm not going to try anything big like CYOA (I'm not sure how I would use that in this kind of scenario anyways). But I will have a music player with a nice soundtrack, custom campaign signs, and some more nice little tidbits to make this mod aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>I will do my best here to capture Reagan's authentic voice and portray him realistically. 1976 is a great mod, but I think it comes up a little short on the Reagan side. I think you can write more like The Gipper without it being comical. This mod will prove that, if it ends up being as good as I know it can.</p><p>Release date? I'm not sure. Maybe tomorrow if I button up these running mates soon. I'll probably get it done soon. Will keep you guys posted.</p><p>Sincerely,<l>Conjunction Junction</p>",
